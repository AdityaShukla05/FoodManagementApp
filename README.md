App to reduce food wastage
Basically this app can be used to store the information about all the kitchen items that have expiry date.
This app keeps the track of the days remaining of an item to expire and accordinly notifies the user.
This app also displayed recipe videos of the food items present in the kitchen hence making food wastage less obvious.
